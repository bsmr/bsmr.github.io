## @Work

I am working at [ADESTIS IT-Service GmbH](http://www.adestis.com/).

Currently my main responsibles are maintaining our hosting environment for different customers, especially the Linux boxes, and help internal and external developers to deploy their code into that environment.

Our hosting environment is not just a bunch of LAMP boxes, instead we try to provide our customers with an HA setup for the various components used.

Another key task is the automation of provisioning the hosting environment, configuration of the various server roles, and enabling rolling updates of the operating system, and the application, without any outtage.

Basically, I am a [senior](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Tenniel_Astrologer.jpg) [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) [BOFH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_Operator_From_Hell)... sort of...
